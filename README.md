# StoryTelling with Maps - MapLibre Workshop - Fall 2024

This is the repository for the Storytelling with maps using MapLibre Workshop of Fall 2024.

The “Storytelling with MapLibre” tutorial teaches participants how to create interactive map-based stories without coding experience. The workshop demonstrates how maps can enhance storytelling by providing visual context and enabling audience participation. You will learn by duplicating and customizing a pre-built template from Digital Democracy to their own GitHub account, using MapLibre GL JS (an open-source mapping library). This hands-on approach allows anyone to create compelling geographic narratives that combine maps with multimedia elements, which can then be shared on the web for others to explore.

This tutorial was created following the tutorial and template by [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123) (UBC) and [Phil White](https://github.com/outpw) (CU Boulder) as part of the Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML) 2020 preconference workshop on teaching with GitHub.
